# AgriPredict
Agriculture recommendation + Generative GPT:.

Problem:


Harvesters are facing challenges in farming due to unpredictable weather conditions. Sudden changes in weather patterns each year—such as unexpected rainfall, droughts, or temperature shifts—make it difficult to plan and manage crop cultivation effectively. As a result, they often experience reduced yields and financial losses.


Solution : 

To address the challenges farmers face due to unpredictable weather, a smart agricultural website can be developed that provides crop and harvesting product recommendations based on climate predictions. This platform would analyze real-time and historical weather data to guide farmers in choosing the most suitable crops, fertilizers, and planting schedules for their region. In addition, the website would feature an AI-powered chatbot capable of offering personalized farming advice. By collecting information such as the farmer’s location, soil type, and crop preferences, the chatbot can deliver tailored solutions, including best practices, risk alerts, and alternative suggestions in case of unfavorable weather forecasts. The chatbot would also support local languages and voice interaction to ensure accessibility for rural users. This solution integrates technologies like machine learning, weather APIs, and natural language processing, using tools such as Python, React, Gemini AI key ,and weather API or Dialogflow. Ultimately, this platform would empower farmers with data-driven insights, helping them reduce weather-related losses, increase productivity, and make informed decisions in a user-friendly and scalable way.
